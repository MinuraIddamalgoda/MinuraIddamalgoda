I'm a software developer in Melbourne, Australia who's interested in all things dev, sys admin, and ops! 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
I'm finishing off the final semester of my degree, where I'll be studying; Computing Theory, Artificial Engineering, Operating Systems Principles, and Soft. Eng. Processes and Tools! So my personal projects will have to be put on the backburner as I (try to) balance work and uni.
